title: Data Analyst Intern
description: At Sevetys, I worked as a Data Analyst on topics related to client and patient data. My responsibilities included Python development using PySpark on Microsoft Azure, data modeling based on business needs, and ensuring data quality. This experience allowed me to deepen my data engineering skills while working autonomously in a demanding cloud-based environment.
